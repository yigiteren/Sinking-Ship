## About
Hi everyone! We are a team of 2 university friends and this is our first game jam. You are in a ship that's in a bad water and gets damaged very often. Your objective is to survive as long as you can by reparing these holes.

You get 100 points for each spawned hole and 100 extra if you repair it. There are 3 different sizes of holes. Size is directly proportional to the water coming from the hole. In order to find where holes appear, you need to listen carefully. Sounds in the game are 3D, meaning you will hear the sounds from their location. Try to use it as. Headphones are highly suggested!

There are 2 pumps in the ship that will decrease water level constantly. These pumps can hold up to 2 big holes.

Holes are generated at random position, so you may need some luck to score high. Don't forget to comment your high score! Good luck!

## How to Play
